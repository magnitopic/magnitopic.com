# **_NOBLE_** ðŸ‘‘

A card game by **_Dany Caballero_**

## Setup

_NOBLE_ is a card game for 2-4 players. The game is played with a standard deck of 52 playing cards.

The **face cards** (king, queen, jack) are split evenly among the players. These cards are the _Nobles_, the betting cards.

-   2 players: 6 face cards each (2K, 2Q, 2J)
-   3 players: 3 face cards each (1K, 1Q, 1J)
-   4 players: 2 face cards each (1K, 1Q)

It is played in rounds. At the start of each round every player must place a **face card** in the middle and they are dealt 9 cards. The starting card is taken from the pile of remaining cards. The player who won the last round starts.

## Gameplay

On your turn you must play a card that's equal or smaller than the current top card.

If you cannot play a card at any point you must:

-   Place a **face card** in the middle
-   Draw a card
-   Take another turn
-   If you still cannot play, pass

If an entire round passes and no one can play, the stack resets. Next player can play any card

If at any point in the game you need to take a card and don't have any **face cards** you lost

The player that runs out of cards first wins the round and gets to keep all the **face cards** in the middle. A new round begins.

## Card rankings

The order of the cards from lowest to highest is: A, **2**, 3, **4**, 5, 6, 7, 8, **9**, 10

### Special Cards

There are 3 special cards in the game:

-   **_9_**: Resets the stack in the middle. The next player can play whatever card they want.
-   **_4_**: The next player must play a card that is higher to the previous played card.
-   **_2_**: The next player must take a card from the pile and it becomes their turn. They must play something higher or equal to the card that was before the 2.

If a special card is played, the next player must play a card that is lower or equal to the card that was played before the special card. Unless the special card contradicts that rule.
